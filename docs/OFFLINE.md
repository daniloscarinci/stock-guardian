# Offline operation

Stock Guardian makes no network requests. Not "few", not "only for updates" —
none. This page describes how that is achieved and, more importantly, how it is
enforced, because a promise like this erodes by accident: one webfont, one
analytics snippet, one CDN fallback added while debugging.

## Verified, not asserted

Three checks run on the real build.

**The build audit.** `npm run build` runs `scripts/audit-offline.mjs` over
`dist/` and fails on any external reference. HTML, CSS, SVG and the manifest are
scanned for any external URL; JavaScript is scanned with comments stripped for
constructs that actually fetch — `fetch()`, `importScripts()`, `new Worker()`,
`.src =`, `sendBeacon()` and the rest. Bundled libraries carry URLs in licence
headers and error messages, and flagging those would produce noise everyone
learns to ignore, which is worse than no check.

**The Content-Security-Policy.** `index.html` declares `default-src 'self'`, so
the browser itself refuses any off-origin request. `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` is
present because instantiating the SQLite module needs it; it grants nothing else.
`frame-ancestors` is deliberately absent: it is ignored in a `<meta>` element and
would look like protection while providing none. Set it as a response header if
you host this somewhere that can.

**The browser test.** `npm run smoke` loads the production build, waits for the
service worker, cuts the network, hard-reloads, and asserts that the dashboard
comes back and the inventory is still readable.

## How it works

**Everything is bundled.** No CDN, no Google Fonts, no remote anything.
Typography uses system font stacks: a webfont is a network request, and this must
render identically with the radio off. Icons are inline SVG. The charts are HTML
and CSS. The SQLite WebAssembly binary — 865 KB — is emitted as a local asset and
precached.

**A hand-written service worker.** `src/sw.ts` precaches the build manifest and
serves cache-first. Cache-first rather than network-first because every asset is
immutable and content-hashed: there is nothing to be fresher about, and
network-first would make behaviour depend on whether the radio happened to be on.

It is written out rather than generated for two reasons. That file *is* the
offline guarantee and should be readable in one sitting. And the generated
alternative could not be built here at all — this project's path contains an
apostrophe, and workbox's template writes absolute module paths into
single-quoted strings, producing a worker that will not parse.

Assets are precached one at a time rather than through `addAll`, which rejects
the whole batch if any single request fails and would leave the worker installed
with nothing cached.

**Updates are prompted, never automatic.** Swapping the service worker while a
write transaction is open against a single-connection database invites trouble.

**On Android, the APK plays that part.** The installed application carries every
asset inside the package, so it has nothing to fetch and no cache to keep warm,
and the Android build ships no service worker at all. The audit below still runs
over the same `dist/`, so the guarantee is enforced identically either way. That
build goes further and asks the operating system for no permission whatsoever —
not even `INTERNET` — which makes "it does not use the network" checkable in the
phone's own settings, and is itself checked on every build. See
`docs/ANDROID.md`.

## Where your data lives

A SQLite database in the browser's Origin Private File System, reached through
the `opfs-sahpool` VFS. It never leaves the device. There is no server to send it
to and no account to attach it to.

`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` explains why that VFS and not the more widely documented
`opfs` one. The short version: `opfs` needs COOP/COEP response headers that a
static host cannot set, so it would work in development and fail for every real
user.

## Three things that can cost you data

Stated plainly, because an application that owns the only copy of something owes
you the truth about its limits.

### A `file://` page cannot store anything

Browsers grant no persistent storage to a page opened directly from a folder. The
application detects this and **refuses to start**, with an explanation, rather
than appearing to work and losing everything you type. Serve it over `https://`
or from `localhost` — see `docs/BUILD.md`.

### The browser can clear your storage

Storage that is not marked *persistent* may be evicted when the device runs short
of space. iOS is the sharpest case: it clears non-persisted sites after roughly
seven days without a visit, which for an application you might not open for
months is a real risk rather than a theoretical one.

Two defences, both worth taking:

- **Settings → Diagnostics → Request persistent storage.** Installing the app to
  the home screen makes the request far more likely to be granted, and on iOS it
  is close to essential.
- **Export a backup now and then**, and keep it somewhere you trust. Settings →
  Backup writes a JSON file to your device.

### One tab at a time

The storage layer permits exactly one connection, which is what stops two copies
overwriting each other. A second tab is detected and told so plainly.

## Checking it yourself

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Open the page, then in DevTools → Application → Service Workers tick **Offline**
and hard-reload. Confirm in the Network tab that `sqlite3-*.wasm` and the worker
chunk are served **from ServiceWorker**, and that the dashboard reaches an
interactive state with your data.

Or turn off your Wi-Fi and use it.
